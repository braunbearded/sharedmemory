# Intro

On [Sharedmemory](https://github.com/braunbearded/sharedmemory) we share our (tech-) hacks, tricks, knowledge and thoughts. That means you can learn something about tech stuff like programming, hardware, operations systems, open source, sorftware, you name it.

You get the information needed right to the point. No blabla, no ads, no distraction.

Everything is open-source so you can check out the progression of this site at any point in time.

This blog is pretty new so you can't see much at the moment, but we are working on it :). To see the "full hack list" click left on [0x00 Hacks](hacks) or check out the recent ones below.
