Are you sick of your simple calculator which can't even convert binary to hexadecimal without a hassle? Do you use google for your calculations? Look no further. I will show you the best (in my opionion) calculator for advanced math on all operating systems. Let's check out the open source, GPL licenced program called **SpeedCrunsh**.

## Requirements

- SpeedCrunsh

## Installation

To install SpeedCrunsh just check out the installation section on [SpeedCrunsh](https://speedcrunch.org/userguide/installation.html), they have you covert there.

### Linux

All mayor package managers have speedcrunsh in their repository:

On Debian based systems run:

```
sudo apt-get install speedcrunch
```

On Fedora based systems run:

```
sudo yum install speedcrunch
```

On Arch based systems run:

```
sudo pacman -S speedcrunsh
```

## Configuration

Not much to configure here beside your font and color pallet and general settings like math stuff and layout. There are some preconfigured themes which are pretty nice. I use "sublime" because it fits my general desktop theme.

You can either configured SpeedCrunsh in the GUI or by the config file somewhere in your home directory (on Linux `~/.config/SpeedCrunsh/SpeedCrunsh.ini`).

If you want some more information check [settings](https://speedcrunch.org/userguide/interface.html#settings) or [advanced topics](https://speedcrunch.org/advanced/index.html).

## Usage

Here is where SpeedCrunsh shines. General usage is pretty strait forward and selfexplaning. The list of build in functions is huge, so I won't cover it here but you can list available function in the GUI by selection `View > Functions` or have a look at [functions](https://speedcrunch.org/reference/basic.html). SpeedCrunsh has some feature that separates it from other advanced calculators. Check some of my favorites below.

### Favorites

No particular order here

1. Seamless switch between number systems at the bottom of the GUI
2. Setting up variables which you can use in your formulas (ex: n = 200)
3. Huge and easy to read history of calculations you did in the past
4. Save/Load different sessions (loads history and variables)
5. Scientific formulas
6. Auto-completion

## Further reading

The documentation for SpeedCrunsh is quite good and not to long so have a look at it: [documentation](https://speedcrunch.org/contents.html).

## Contribute

It seems SpeedCrunsh is not under heavy development so if you want to contribute visit the official [bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/heldercorreia/speedcrunch/src/master/).
