Gaming is an essential part of my life. I spend a lot of time running through virtual landscapes and 
gathering virtual materials. Most of the time I control the game with keyboard and mouse but sometimes 
I want to lay back and use a controller instead. Here I will show you, how you can map your keyboard and mouse 
inputs to a controller. 

## The setup

I game mainly on my windows machine and as such the software I am recommending below is only available for 
windows. There are a lot of other alternatives though. For Linux users I advise on searching for the `joy2key`
package available for most distributions, I am keen to test it, though I don't play any games on Linux. 

Further the controller I use is a XBOX One controller (the basic non-elite version) but the software I present here 
works with every controller that is recognized as one.

To map the keyboard inputs I use a software called [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/). This program 
is shareware and can be downloaded and used for free without limitation, although I highly recommend 
supporting the devs by purchasing a license key after evaluating, that it works for your setup. 
The installation is straight forward and after that you are good to go. 

## Adding a configuration

You might wonder, how can one map a keyboard with hundreds of possible input combinations to a controller.
And you have a point. It is impossible to emulate the full potential of a keyboard and mouse. 
So the first question you have to ask yourself is, which are the most important key- and mousebinds 
you want to map. For me the main game I use it on is the MMORPG Guild Wars 2. The game has a lot of abilities and 
controls connected to keybinds, but when only running around in the open world doing non-skillbased gameplay, 
it actually dials down to around 10 keybinds which are necessary. 

The use of the analog sticks is straight forward. One is for `WASD` while the other controlls mouse movement. 
All the other buttons can be assigned by choice afterwards. I would recommend using the shoulder buttons for 
often clicked abilities since they are easy and comfortable to reach.

## Experiences

I tested `JoyToKey` for a few weeks now and have to say that I am really happy with the result. 
The latency is very low and there are no wrongly interpreted inputs. The deadzones of analog sticks 
are recognized correctly. The amount of features like auto-clicking and multiple mappings for one 
button by timing the input lengths is really nice and adds a lot of immersion. 
It takes a bit of time refining the configuration and getting used to it afterwards but it gave me 
a whole new gaming experience enjoying my favourite games without cramping hands after hours of playtime.
All in all the ability to map keyboard and mouse inputs to a controller enables new possibilities in gaming
and I highly recomend it to everyone who is playing a lot of non-competitive chilled games.
